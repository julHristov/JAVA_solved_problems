Here are some solved problems:

For example:
Biblioteque: 
Annie goes to her hometown after a very long period outside the country. On her way home, she sees her grandmother's old library and 
remembers her favorite book. Help Annie by writing a program in which you enter the search from her book (text). 
Until Annie finds her favorite book or checks out all the books in the library, the program must read each time on a new line 
the name of each subsequent book (text) she checks out. 
The books in the library are finished with the text "No More Books".
    • If you do not find the book you are looking for, print it in two lines:
    • "The book you are looking for is not here!"
    • "You checked out {number} of books."
    • If you find your book, one line is printed:
        ◦ "You checked {number} books and found them."
